    "### Section 15.1.0: Small World\n",
    "\n",
    "Many, if not most, networks evidence the small world property made popular by pop-culture references to \"six degrees of separation\" - or possibly the game \"six degrees of Kevin Bacon\", in which you attempt to link any actor/actress to Kevin Bacon with no more than six connections (through movies). What we would like to show in this section of the lab is that this small world effect is a fundamental network effect. It comes about because of the types of connections that exist in most types of networks. To see this more clearly we are going to introduce our first random graph (we'll see more of these later in the lab). Researchers developed this type of undirected graph for this very purpose and called the networks it generates *small world networks*. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several (many?) ways to build a small world network.  In our approach here, a small world network is created based on a number of nodes, `n`, the number of local connections, `q` (which must be even), and the probability to randomly connect nodes, `p` (which is between 0 and 1). First, `n` nodes are added to the network and formed into a big circle according to their index. Then each node is connected to the `q` nodes closest to it along the circle - so each node is connected to the `q/2` nodes next to it on its \"left\" and the `q/2` nodes next to it on its \"right\". The second step is to randomly connect any two nodes according to a certain probability. This means we pick every pair of nodes and essentially flip a coin (a coin with unequal probabilities for heads and tails: `p` for heads and `1-p` for tails). If the coin is heads, then we create an edge between the two nodes. If it is tails, we do not add an edge. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the stub code, I already have a function `small_world(...)` that creates the small world network and then we start the visualizer. Run the code without modification and it will (in the visualizer) show you the network created in the first step with only local connections, and then after a few seconds it will add the random connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to calculate the diameter exactly, but [write down your (visual) observations about the diameter of the network with only the local connections and then with the random connections added in. In the first case, without random connections, why is the diameter so high?][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go a little bit further to investigate this and look at the next block in the stub code. The parameter `p` controls the amount of random connectivity that is added to the network. Let's see what happens as we change `p` from a small value (near 0) to a large value (near 1). I already have the for loop set up for you with a new small world network being generated with increasingly larger `p`. Your job is to calculate the diameter (recall the [`nx.diameter(G)`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.distance_measures.diameter.html?highlight=diameter) function) and store it in a list. Once you have that stored, use the next chunk of code in that block to [plot the diameter versus the `p` values][3]. The small world effect claims that the diameter of the graph should scale proportional to `log(n)`. In the second plot statement, I've already plotted this value.\n",

    "As we have mentioned in class, the degree distributions of many networks - or at least part of the degree distributions - can often be captured well by a power law model: $p_k = Ck^{-\\alpha}$. Here, we will take a closer look at fitting data from three real networks to a power law.\n",

    "Ultimately, we are interested in computing the exponent $\\alpha$. Recall the formula discussed in class (equation 8.6 in Newman):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha = 1 + N \\left[ \\sum_i \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_i}{k_{\\text{min}}-0.5}\\right)\\right]^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on the cutoff degree $k_\\text{min}$, $N$ is the number of nodes with degree greater than or equal to $k_\\text{min}$, and the sum is performed over only the nodes with $k_i \\geq k_\\text{min}$. Here, we will simply use visual inspection to select $k_\\text{min}$. There is a subtle point in the equation for $\\alpha$ that is easy to miss: the $k_i$ is really the degree *sequence* - not the degree *distribution* - so if 7 nodes have degree of 4, then $k_i=4$ is repeated 7 times in the sum of this formula. There is a corresponding quantification of the uncertainty in equation (8.7) in Newman.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the power law model is meant to represent the degree distribution, this is a good place to start. As we've discussed, we can overcome some challenges of working directly with the degree distribution, by instead looking at the cumulative degree distribution. The exponent of the degree distribution is $\\alpha$, whereas the exponent of the cumulative degree distribution is $\\alpha-1$. I have provided functions for both of these quantities in the stub code, `degree_distribution(...)` and `cumulative_degree_distribution(...)`. In Python the degree distribution is a NumPy array such that the `k`th element (`v[k]`) is the number of nodes with degree `k`. If you set the `normalize=True`, then the `k`th element is the fraction of nodes with degree `k`. This is the same as dividing by the number of nodes. Likewise, in Python the cumulative degree distribution is a NumPy array where the `k`th element is the fraction of nodes with degree `k` or more (notice that this is automatically normalized).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Use these functions to create two plots - one of the degree distribution, which will be a bar plot, and one of the cumulative degree distribution][5], which should be plotted on a log-log plot (where both axes are logarithmically spaced). The code to plot this in Python is already in the stub code, but you have to insert what the \"x\" and \"y\" values should be. Use these plots to determine a good $k_\\text{min}$. This will specify the bottom of the range of degrees for which the cumulative degree distribution plot appears linear. I've selected these graphs on purpose so that they show you varying levels of power-law behavior. One of them doesn't really follow a power-law, but find a fit for it anyway. Recall that the power-law is a tail phenomena, describing the relative number of hubs, hence we look to fit the tail of the distribution with a power-law degree distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have your $k_\\text{min}$ value in hand, you'll be able to [calculate $\\alpha$ and the corresponding uncertainty, $\\sigma$ for each of the networks][6]. \n",

    "### Sections 12-12.5: Giant Component in the Erdos-Renyi Random Graph\n",
    "One of the important phenomena related to the random graph model `G(n,p)` is the sudden emergence of the giant component when the average degree exceeds a value of one. Your goal is to recreate the figure that plots the fraction of nodes in the giant component (y-axis) against the average degree (x-axis) - the right plot of Figure 12.1 in Newman. [NetworkX has several random network models built in](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generators.html#module-networkx.generators.random_graphs). For this section you will use the function [`nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n,p)`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.erdos_renyi_graph.html#networkx.generators.random_graphs.erdos_renyi_graph). You are also likely going to want to use the function [`nx.connected_components(...)`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.components.connected_components.html?highlight=connected_components#networkx.algorithms.components.connected_components) to identify the size of the largest component in the network. This function returns a generator of sets, where each set is a component of the graph and contains the nodes within the component. Another useful function will be [numpy.arange(a,b,step)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html), where this generates points from `a` up to, but not including `b` by steps of `step`, e.g., `numpy.arange(0,2,0.5)` produces `[0.0,0.5,1.0,1.5]`. This is like the `range(a,b)` function you may have already used, but now returns a NumPy array. While you can compute the data for this plot several different ways, letâ€™s specifically plot fraction of nodes in the giant component against the *expected* average degree â€“ this will let you pick a value for `c` and then determine the value of `p` that should (on average) generate a graph with this expected average degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have now seen several examples of plotting, so use that same general structure to make this plot.  It should look something like: `plt.plot(c,S,â€™bâ€™,linewidth=2)` to plot the list `c` as the x-values and `S` as the y-values and make the line blue with thickness 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your plot, you'll notice that the line is pretty rough and in some cases it may go up and down, even though the theoretical results predicts a curve for the expected giant component size that is monotonic with increasing average degree. [Why are you seeing this non-monotonic behavior?][7]\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to overcoming this (which you should now implement), is to average the values of component size over many instances of the \"same\" random graph, i.e., generate many random graphs with the same parameters `(n, p)` and take the average of their giant component sizes. This is a common approach when conducting empirical work with random networks. Because these models represent a family â€“ a distribution in fact â€“ of graphs, studying just one instance is rarely enough to make a general assessment related to the model.  An easy way to compute the average of many instances is to put them all into a NumPy array, let's call it `a`, (it has to be an array, not a list, to do this next step) and then use [`a.mean()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.mean.html) (this function is actually a method of the object type NumPy array, but it is the same as this general NumPy function of the same name [`numpy.mean(a)`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html)). To be clear about the variation we are seeing between different graph instances (essentially to tell people how representative the mean statistic is), we should also calculate the standard deviation of the values, which we can do with [`a.std()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.std.html) (see similar function [`numpy.std(a)`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.std.html)). To plot the standard deviation, we need error bars, which can be done easily with `plt.errorbar(c,S_mean,yerr=S_std)`, where `yerr` is the size of the error bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this plot to observe the \"convergence\" of the Erdos-Renyi model to its expected behavior as the graph gets larger. [Make three plots, one for n=10, one for n=100, and one for n=1000][8]. Now that you are essentially going to use the same code more than once, except for this parameter change, good programming practice says that you should put this into a function that you can then call as many times as you need. So create a function that creates this plot and takes as input arguments the number of nodes and the number of graphs to average over (this will involve moving most of your current code into a new function). Now just call that function three times, for `n=10`, `n=100`, and `n=1000`. The call for `n=1000` will likely take a couple of minutes to calculate, so stretch and practice some yoga while you wait. [Observe the differences in the plots and explain how this supports the notion that the statistics of the model converge to their expected values as n gets larger][9]. When you turn in your code, comment out the command for the `n=1000` version (this will save us a lot of time grading, and anyway we've already practiced our yoga).\n",
    "\n",
    "For extra insight (this paragraph is just for your own understanding and not to be turned in), set the number of graphs that you are averaging over to be 1 again. Now the curve is generated from just one Erdos-Renyi graph again. You can see the effect of convergence very clearly!\n",

    "### Visualizing Methods of Formation\n",
    "Because this section doesn't have a deliverable (nothing to turn in), you should create this in a separate python file. We will use the visualizer to watch how networks are created under various methods of formation. zen has implementations of Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert models already, however, they are not ready to use with the visualizer, so I have reimplemented them in the file randomnet.py, which should already be a part of the zend3js folder. Since you will already import that folder for the visualizer, just add import randomnet as well in your import statements.  The documentation of the built-in versions still apply to the randomnet versions, only the new ones also take a graph parameter as well. The built-in generating methods for Local Attachment and Duplication Divergence are, however, ready to use. In each case, you will want to create an empty graph: G = zen.Graph() (or zen.DiGraph()) and give this to the visualizer. Then call the formation method, i.e., one of the following, to watch the graph be built:\n",
    "\n",
    "G = randomnet.erdos_renyi_graph(30,0.1,graph=G)\n",
    "G = randomnet.local_attachment_graph(30,3,2,graph=G)\n",
    "G = randomnet.barabasi_albert_graph(30,4,graph=G)\n",
    "G = randomnet.duplication_divergence_graph(30,0.1,graph=G)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Local Attachment is the only type one that you have to use a DiGraph (the others have directed versions, however, it is simpler just to use the undirected version for now). Also, you have already seen the small world network be built in a previous lab. Feel free to adjust the parameters of the model and observe the changes in the output.\n",

    "### Degree Distributions of Random Network Models\n",
    "We discussed several models of network formation in lecture, namely, Erdos-Renyi (ER), small-world (SM), Barabasi-Albert (BA, preferential attachment), Local Attachment (LA), Duplication Divergence (DD). We noted that in the limit, ER graphs have a Poisson degree distribution; that BA, LA, and DD have scale free distributions; and that SM has a vaguely right-skewed distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in this lab, we plotted the degree distributions of several real world graphs. [Use this same code to look at the degree distributions and cumulative degree distributions of these networks.

Save these figures and create a summary as part of your PDF submission. In this document, make sure the label the plots with their corresponding network model and parameters. Also note the ones that exhibit scale-free degree distributions. [What are their power-law exponents?][11]\n",

    "### Fitting Random Models\n",
    "While random network models are used to understand how a formation mechanism leads to network properties, they are also used as coarse approximations of real world networks.  To get a sense for how to tune network models, and observe some deficiencies, try selecting parameters for the ER, LA, and DD models to match the basic network properties of a real world network including number of nodes and edges (and hence the average degree), average clustering (see [`average_clustering(...)`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.cluster.average_clustering.html#networkx.algorithms.cluster.average_clustering)), and degree distribution (use the same code you developed earlier to plot the degree distribution).  In some cases, we have discussed analytic relationships between a parameter and these network statistics â€“ for example, there is an expression that relates the ER probability `p` to the expected number of edges in the graph.  For other parameters, you will have to make educated iterative guesses (or some sort of regression).  In addition to these random network models, also investigate the properties of the configuration model, using [`nx.configuration_model(...)`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.degree_seq.configuration_model.html#networkx.generators.degree_seq.configuration_model). Earlier in the stub code I provided a function `degree_sequence(...)` that will produce the degree sequence to be used with the configuration model.
